# Paper
I am writing to you regarding manuscript # Access-2023-18363 entitled "An Adaptive Multi-Layer Anti-Lock Braking Control Method Based on Fuzzy Logic" which you submitted to IEEE Access.

Your article was peer reviewed with interest but has not been recommended for publication in its current form.  We strongly encourage you to address the reviewers’ concerns, which can be found at the bottom of this letter, and resubmit your article to IEEE Access once you have updated it accordingly.
 
Please note that IEEE Access has a binary peer review process. Therefore, to uphold quality to IEEE standards, an article is rejected even if it requires minor edits.
 
When updating your manuscript, you should elaborate on your points and clarify with references, examples, data, etc. If you disagree with any technical points the reviewers have made, please include your counterarguments in your response to the reviewers (more information detailed below) and work this into the updated manuscript. Also, note that if a reviewer suggested references, you should only add those that are relevant to your work if you feel they strengthen your article. Recommending references to specific publications is not appropriate for reviewers and you should report excessive cases to ieeeaccessEIC@ieee.org.
 
If the updated manuscript is determined not to have addressed all of the previous reviewers’ concerns, or if the Associate Editor still has substantial technical concerns, the article may be rejected and no further resubmissions will be allowed.
 
When you are ready to resubmit your updated article, you can do so in the IEEE Author Portal.  When you log into the IEEE Author Portal you ill see the title of the rejected article and the option to “Start Resubmission”.  
 
Upon resubmission you will be asked to upload the following 3 files:

1) A document containing your response to reviewers from the previous peer review.  The “response to reviewers” document (template attached) should have the following regarding each comment: a) Reviewer’s concern, b) your response to the concern, c) your action to remedy the concern. The document should be uploaded with your manuscript files under "Author's Response Files.”

2) Your updated manuscript with all your individual changes highlighted, including grammatical changes (e.g. preferably with the yellow highlight tool within the pdf file). This file should be uploaded with your manuscript files as “Supplementary material for review but not for publication.”

3) A clean copy of the final manuscript (without highlighted changes) submitted as a Word or LaTeX file, and as a PDF, both submitted as the “Main Manuscript.”

**IMPORTANT: Please see the attached Resubmission Checklist that details all the items listed above.  Please utilize this checklist to ensure you have made the necessary edits to your manuscript, and to ensure you have all the necessary files prepared prior to resubmission.

*** AUTHOR LIST CHANGES: If your revised manuscript has an updated author list, you will need to submit a formal request to the Editor by completing the attachment labelled ‘Request for Byline Change,’ and uploading it as 'Supplementary material for review but not for publication.' This should include a DETAILED justification explaining each author’s contribution(s) to the work. Change in the author list is considered rare and exceptional, and the decision to allow such changes rests with the Editor. Once the list and order of authors has been established, the list and order of authors should not be altered without permission of all living authors of that article.

We sincerely hope you will update your manuscript and resubmit soon. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Thank you for your interest in IEEE Access.

Sincerely,

Dr. Shun-Feng Su
Associate Editor, IEEE Access
